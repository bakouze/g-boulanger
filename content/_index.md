Hi! This website is, first and foremost, for me.

I created it as a place to collect and revisit the notes I take on the books I read and the thoughts I have about various topics. If you stumble upon this site and find something useful here, that’s great, but that’s not the primary goal. This is a personal space where I track what I think, how I think, and how my thinking evolves over time.

Some time ago, I realized that my memory, like everyone’s, is imperfect. I forget events, I forget details from books I’ve read, and I even forget insights that once felt important. To some extent, that’s okay. The ideas we absorb often change us subtly, even if we forget where they came from. But I also started to feel that some thoughts are worth preserving, not necessarily the facts themselves, but the reflections and questions they sparked in me.

In that sense, this site is a kind of time capsule. A place where I can revisit snapshots of my mind at different points in my life.

A turning point for me was reading [“Why Books Don’t Work” by Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/books/), which challenged how I thought about reading and memory. That article led me to *How to Take Smart Notes* by Sönke Ahrens, where I discovered the Zettelkasten method: a way of building knowledge by writing and linking short, meaningful notes. I tried using tools like Obsidian to implement it. I watched videos, explored best practices, but the truth is, the habit never fully stuck.

I kept reading, but I rarely paused to take good notes. And when I did, I didn’t invest enough time reviewing or refining them.

So this website is a new attempt. A more public one. I’m committing to publishing **2 short articles every months**, drawn from my notes, to help me stay accountable and turn this into a long-lasting habit.

If these reflections ever help someone else think differently, that’s the cherry on top.
