&lt;p>Over the past five years, both in my own athletic journey and through helping friends start running or cycling, I’ve seen the same problem repeatedly: &lt;strong>people are either stuck at the starting line or plateau far below their potential&lt;/strong>, not because they lack discipline, but because the tools, advice, and support they need are fragmented, impersonal, and often counterproductive.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>1. For Beginners: Getting Started Feels Overwhelming or Risky&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="1-for-beginners-getting-started-feels-overwhelming-or-risky">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#1-for-beginners-getting-started-feels-overwhelming-or-risky" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Motivation barrier&lt;/strong>: Many aspiring runners or cyclists never take the first step. Advice online is contradictory, intimidating, and disconnected from their personal situation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>No easy entry point&lt;/strong>: Establishing a routine feels impossible without structure or feedback.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The “Strava trap”&lt;/strong>: Motivated beginners often do too much too soon, chasing metrics and public validation. They feel embarrassed to post short, slow workouts, push beyond safe limits, get injured, and quit for months.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>One-size-fits-all advice&lt;/strong>: Current beginner training plans treat all novices the same, ignoring starting fitness, health conditions, or past athletic experience. An already-fit cyclist and an overweight sedentary beginner get the same generic plan, which is ineffective for both.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2>2. For Intermediate &amp;amp; Advanced Amateurs: Training Is Fragmented and Untailored&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="2-for-intermediate--advanced-amateurs-training-is-fragmented-and-untailored">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#2-for-intermediate--advanced-amateurs-training-is-fragmented-and-untailored" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Scattered tools&lt;/strong>: Athletes juggle multiple platforms for plans (TrainingPeaks, Garmin Coach), tracking (Garmin, Strava, Whoop), and nutrition, none of which talk to each other.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Generic or expensive plans&lt;/strong>: Paid plans are static, rarely adapted to real-life performance. Coaches can personalize but are expensive, slow to respond, and limited by human bandwidth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>No true multi-sport integration&lt;/strong>: Marathon plans don’t account for cycling and strength training sessions; triathlon training doesn’t dynamically adapt to changes in any single discipline.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>No holistic adaptation&lt;/strong>: Current tools don’t combine training data with recovery, sleep, nutrition, and goals to provide integrated, real-time adjustments.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Multiple goals conflict&lt;/strong>: Athletes with diverse objectives (e.g., sub-3 marathon, summer bike races, muscle building) are left to manually reconcile conflicting advice and plans.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Nutrition &amp;amp; supplementation ignored&lt;/strong>: Most training plans are blind to dietary habits, micronutrient deficiencies, or supplements that could improve performance.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2>3. The Core Gap: A True AI-Powered, Holistic Coach for All Athletes&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="3-the-core-gap-a-true-ai-powered-holistic-coach-for-all-athletes">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#3-the-core-gap-a-true-ai-powered-holistic-coach-for-all-athletes" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Today, only &lt;strong>professional athletes with full-time coaches, nutritionists, and health staff&lt;/strong> can truly optimize every aspect of training and health. For everyone else, data already captured by smartwatches and health trackers sits underused in silos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In an era where &lt;strong>AI can process and personalize vast amounts of data instantly&lt;/strong>, it is absurd that most athletes, beginner or advanced, still rely on static, generic advice. There’s a massive opportunity for an &lt;strong>AI-driven, fully integrated coaching solution&lt;/strong> that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Meets beginners where they are&lt;/strong>, removing friction, building habits safely, and keeping motivation high.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Optimizes advanced athletes’ training&lt;/strong>, integrating all available data (training load, recovery, nutrition, sleep) to adapt plans in real time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Democratizes elite-level coaching&lt;/strong>, making it accessible at a fraction of the cost.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;img src="AI_startup_journey.png" alt="AI Startup Journey" loading="lazy" />&lt;p>I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of creating my own business. As a child, my dream wasn’t to start a startup or join a big company: it was to invent a teleportation device. I suffered from motion sickness and imagined how wonderful it would be to zap from one place to another without the long, uncomfortable hours in between.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Years later, while studying in Chicago, three friends and I took our first real shot at entrepreneurship. What started as a class assignment grew into something bigger: a startup idea we called HubRoad. The concept was simple but powerful: help students track their job applications in one place, while also providing key resources like interview prep tips and company insights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We learned so much in the process: built a business strategy, created a pitch deck, developed a Minimum Viable Product, and coded both the front and back ends ourselves. We even won a prize in our school’s startup competition. At the time, we dreamed big! We wanted to become the next Elon Musk and be rich and famous.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But reality soon caught up with us. We graduated, started our careers, and struggled to keep the project alive while working full-time and living in different cities. Eventually, HubRoad faded away.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>A Shift in Motivation&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="a-shift-in-motivation">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#a-shift-in-motivation" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Now, several years later, I find myself drawn again to the idea of starting a side project. But this time, my motivation is different. I’m not chasing fame or fortune, I want to keep learning. Technology and business strategies evolved so quickly that the best way to stay curious is to experiment firsthand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The biggest difference compared to ten years ago? We now have AI as a creative partner. Instead of staring at a blank page or waiting for inspiration, I can brainstorm with ChatGPT and generate ideas step by step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, inspired by Anne-Laure Le Cunff’s book Tiny Experiments, I decided to run one myself. I opened ChatGPT and typed:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Can you ask me a set of questions, one after the other, to help me figure out the best side hustle opportunity based on my skills?”&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>The Power of AI Brainstorming&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="the-power-of-ai-brainstorming">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#the-power-of-ai-brainstorming" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The experience surprised me. Instead of spitting out random suggestions, ChatGPT guided me through a reflection process:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What skills do I enjoy using?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What motivates me?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What problems do I care about solving?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Step by step, the questions helped me connect dots and learn about my motivations. By the end, I had landed on an idea that felt like me: &lt;strong>a habit-building app for aspiring runners and cyclists that rewards consistency and small wins&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>What’s Next&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="whats-next">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#whats-next" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I don’t know yet where this experiment will lead, but that’s exactly the point. This time, the journey matters more than the outcome. Building a side project with AI isn’t about chasing the next big thing; it’s about using powerful new tools to learn, create, and grow along the way.&lt;/p>
