        &lt;img src=&#34;AI_startup_journey.png&#34; alt=&#34;AI Startup Journey&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of creating my own business. As a child, my dream wasn’t to start a startup or join a big company: it was to invent a teleportation device. I suffered from motion sickness and imagined how wonderful it would be to zap from one place to another without the long, uncomfortable hours in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, while studying in Chicago, three friends and I took our first real shot at entrepreneurship. What started as a class assignment grew into something bigger: a startup idea we called HubRoad. The concept was simple but powerful: help students track their job applications in one place, while also providing key resources like interview prep tips and company insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned so much in the process: built a business strategy, created a pitch deck, developed a Minimum Viable Product, and coded both the front and back ends ourselves. We even won a prize in our school’s startup competition. At the time, we dreamed big! We wanted to become the next Elon Musk and be rich and famous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But reality soon caught up with us. We graduated, started our careers, and struggled to keep the project alive while working full-time and living in different cities. Eventually, HubRoad faded away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Shift in Motivation&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;a-shift-in-motivation&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-shift-in-motivation&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, several years later, I find myself drawn again to the idea of starting a side project. But this time, my motivation is different. I’m not chasing fame or fortune, I want to keep learning. Technology and business strategies evolved so quickly that the best way to stay curious is to experiment firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest difference compared to ten years ago? We now have AI as a creative partner. Instead of staring at a blank page or waiting for inspiration, I can brainstorm with ChatGPT and generate ideas step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, inspired by Anne-Laure Le Cunff’s book Tiny Experiments, I decided to run one myself. I opened ChatGPT and typed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Can you ask me a set of questions, one after the other, to help me figure out the best side hustle opportunity based on my skills?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Power of AI Brainstorming&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;the-power-of-ai-brainstorming&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-power-of-ai-brainstorming&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience surprised me. Instead of spitting out random suggestions, ChatGPT guided me through a reflection process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What skills do I enjoy using?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What motivates me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What problems do I care about solving?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step by step, the questions helped me connect dots and learn about my motivations. By the end, I had landed on an idea that felt like me: &lt;strong&gt;a habit-building app for aspiring runners and cyclists that rewards consistency and small wins&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s Next&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#whats-next&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know yet where this experiment will lead, but that’s exactly the point. This time, the journey matters more than the outcome. Building a side project with AI isn’t about chasing the next big thing; it’s about using powerful new tools to learn, create, and grow along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
